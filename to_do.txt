experimenting with (l1,ssim) checkpoints
1) train standard gan with d-iters 2 (doing tmux 0)
2) train lsgan with d_iters 2 (doing tmux 1)




#train again using
small learning rate
more epoch
increasing the blocks of esrt if possible
including mean and median blur
using upsample with pixelshuffle (already there)




Doing (In this exp dataset class is chnaged so that patch is extracted after creating lr image to correct the over lightning effect on output images)
1.train ph1:l1,ssim(version 2) including mean and median blur (tmux 0)
2. train ph1: l1, ssim, pyramid, tv (version 2) including mean and median blur and low_lr_rate and more epochs and l1_wt=1.0, ssim=1.0, tv_weight=0.01, pyramid_wt=0.1
